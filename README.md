# Polynomial-Curve-Fitting

Analyzes a set of data points using polynomial regression. Fits the data using linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials to determine which model best represents the relationship between x and y.

---

## Description

- Given a set of five data points
- Uses the `polyfit` function to generate polynomial models of varying degrees
- Plots each line of best fit over a smoothed x-range for visual comparison
- Helps understand how higher-degree polynomials can lead to better (or worse) fits

The quartic model will fit the data best due to its flexibility, but the plot allows visual analysis of each curveâ€™s accuracy and overfitting potential.

## Features

- Fits data with polynomials from degree 1 to 4
- Uses MATLAB plotting tools for comparison
- Easily expandable to higher-order fits

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Regression and curve fitting
- Polynomial modeling
- Data visualization in MATLAB
- Overfitting vs. underfitting
